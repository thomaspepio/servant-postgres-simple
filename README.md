# A toy project to fiddle with Servant and postgresql-simple

A toy-project to demonstrate why Haskell has what is called _"hexa / clean architecture"_ for free.

### Get started
You will need :
 - ghc
 - stack
 - cabal
 - docker

Then just... :
 1. `db/rundb.sh`, will start a container and create the user/tables/data for you
 2. `stack build`, will compile/link the sources and give you an executable
 3. run the app !
